# Fylo Dark Theme Landing Page

This is the dark theme version of Fylo - a web-based application that stores your most important files in one secure location.

## Description

Fylo is a fictional file hosting service created by the owner(s) of [Frontend Mentor](https://beta.frontendmentor.io/). Designed to reduce busywork, Fylo brings your files together in one central place, safely syncs them across all of your devices, and provides you with a creative collaboration workspace where you can stay connected with you team any time, anywhere.

This landing page is built with pure HTML5 and CSS3 preprocessed by Sass in SCSS syntax. A huge part of CSS flexbox is used for experimental purpose.
